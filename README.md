1. Navigate to the folder in your command line and run `npm install` on the root folder. This will install packages for the `root`, `client`, and `server` folders.
2. Make sure you have a MongoDB client running on your system in order to create a local database.
3. Then run `npm run develop` from the command line to load both the client side in a browser and access the DB through the graphql Apollo explorer.
